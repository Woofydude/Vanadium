```

## Config example

`"port": "8080"` = Sets HTTP server port of web proxy. Ports 1-1024 cannot be used without running this service with root access.

`"ssl": "false"` = Sets HTTP server SSL. This is best left as false, as nginx and cloudflare can provide SSL.

`"prefix": "/search/"` = Sets the prefix of the web proxy. If you change this, you must edit main.js to reflect the different prefix.

`"localAddresses": [ "0.0.0.0" ]` = Allows you to choose which IP to make the request from. If there are multiple IP's then the IP chosen will be randomized.

`"blockedHostnames": [ "example.com", "example.org" ]` = If the hostname of the proxy URL matches any of the URL hostnames listed in the array, the request to the server will be cancelled.

## Features

- Fully functional Omnibox. Search, URL entry, and search suggestions all in one place.

- A simplistic, no-frills design that is easy for anyone to pick up and use.

- A mobile-responsive design makes this frontend usable on both mobile devices and traditional computers.

- A work-in-progress arcade featuring classic Adobe Flash games, all working thanks to Ruffle.rs.
